\section{Task 1: Requirement elicitation (1.1, 1.2)}

\subsection{Domain Context}

HCMUT is a multi-disciplinary and multi-major university with emphasis on technology. It has several campuses and more than 20,000 students,  including undergraduates and graduates. The university is intended to implement a smart printing system to provide printing service to its students.

The system leverages a network of printers distributed in different campus locations, allowing students to print documents by uploading files, choosing preferred printers, and specifying printing properties. The key functionalities include secure student authentication through HCMUT’s SSO, logging of all printing actions, management of printer resources by the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO), and the ability for students to monitor and manage their printing activities.

Every student receives a default number of A4-sized pages per semester, which they can use for printing, with the option to buy additional pages if needed. The system enforces printing limits based on the student's remaining page balance, and it supports online payments via university systems such as BK-Pay. Students can upload documents to the system and customize their printing options, including selection of paper size, page ranges and more.

For administration, the SPSO can configure and manage the entire printing network, including enabling/disabling printers, setting default page allocations, and defining permitted file types. Additionally, detailed printing logs and usage reports are available, ensuring transparency for both students and SPSO. The service operates through both a web app and a mobile app, offering convenience and accessibility to all users across campus.

This system is designed to streamline the document printing process, enhance accessibility, and efficiently manage printing resources for the university community.
