\section{Task 1.1: Requirement elicitation(1.1, 1.2)}

\subsection{Domain Context}

\subsubsection{Problem statement}
Currently, the demand for printing among university students in Vietnam, particularly students at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), is increasing significantly. Printed learning materials are becoming more useful to students in their studies. However, with traditional printing services offered by printing shops, several problems remain, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students may need to travel a long distance to reach printing shops.
    \item The number of students is much greater than the number of printing shops, which means students might have to wait in long lines if there are many printing requests.
    \item Customizing print formats can be difficult due to communication between students and shop owners.
    \item There is no guarantee that the information in printed materials will not be disclosed when sending them to the printing shop.
    \item Printing services often do not display prices or provide receipts, making it hard for students to manage their printing expenses.
    \item Sending files through various platforms can lead to errors, making file management challenging.
    \item There is no guarantee that the information in printed materials will not be disclosed when sending them to the printing shop.
    \item Print requests can only be made at the shop, meaning students have to wait for their requests to be completed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solution}
The HCMUT\_SSPS printing service system is developed to address these issues. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Printing stations are set up in various locations across the campus, making it convenient for students to travel. In addition, students can choose the most suitable printing station based on their schedules.
    \item The system is developed on a web platform, providing a remote printing service, minimizing waiting times at the printing stations.
    \item The system gives students full control over uploading files and adjusting print configurations, ensuring they get their prints exactly as they want.
    \item The system uses the number of A4 pages as a currency unit for the printing service. Students can deposit money and use it to make print requests. Each A4 page has a fixed price, and the system can calculate and display the total cost of a print request.
    \item The printing history and the page purchase history are stored in the system, allowing students to access and review their activities.
\end{itemize}
